# Fraud NGO asking money

## Initiation
Call for donation for dying children

## Process
- You get a call for donating urgently to dying children in ICU
- If you ask for proof they'll ask you to open ngo.india.gov.in which is a legitimate website
- They'll give you a unique ID to search in that portal.
- The NGO name will show up with details and a web link to NGO's portal.
- Website has documents like PAN card and government certificates leading you to believe it's legit. That will also have pictures of children admitted in the hospital in severe conditions. 
- Example prathamfoundation.org, Mother Concern  
- They'll guilt you into paying.

## Mechanism
- The website and documents may be fake.
- It's easy to register a fake NGO with government.

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- Legitimate NGOs don't employ high pressure sales tactics to urge you to pay
- Do not ever donate over a single call. Sleep over it.
