# Fake job interview

## Initiation
You get a job opportunity email from a credible looking email like info@careernaukri.com 

## Process
"https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xq9aoc/urgent_victim_of_job_fraud_of_inr_32200_complete/

If you call the number given in the email, the person will interview you. He'd sound smart and knowledgeable leading you to trust them. 
They'll ask you for a refundable deposit of some amount before proceeding.

Even if you give deposit they'll try to ask you for more giving XYZ reason. 

You'll lose all the money you sent."


## Mechanism
Anybody can create a domain name sounding similar to other legit companies. naukri.com vs careernaukri.com

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- Always verify domain name. Check on google the legitimate company's website and contact them directly.
- Giving a mid-to-large sum of money for any reason during a job interview isn't worth the risk of it being a fraud.
