- If you've searched for something like "booking" or "application", they'd have a form and payment process. 
- If you call the number they'll trick you to give out your details, or use the UPI tricks for cheating you out of money.

## Mechanism
- Anybody can buy top spot on google ads.
- SEO tricks can move a fake website above a legitimate website. 

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- If you don't know before hand the correct web address, please check official sources to confirm the website address, such as official Amazon app, news paper for passport website, etc.
- For government websites check URL bar for ".gov.in" 
- For new website search for "XYZ website fraud" to see consumer complaints on any website and verify nobody else has reported anything wrong.
