# Nude videocall blackmail

## Initiation
- You get a video call from an unknown number on whatsapp or elsewhere

## Process
- As soon as you open the video call you see a nude girl on the other side
- You quickly hang up.
- You get a blackmail message from the number that they'd share the recording of you on the call with the girl with your friends and family on facebook;
- They try to extort money.
- If you send the money once they'd ask again after some days. 

## Mechanism
- The blackmailer can record a video call with your face.
- The blackmailer uses the taboo against the obscene nature of the call against people vulnerable to such exposure, such as people (mainly men) in prestigious positions.  

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- Never pick up video calls from unknown numbers.
- If you can't avoid such calls in your profession, start video calls by covering your camera with your palm.
- Do not give any money to the blackmailers, they'd keep asking for more.
- Cyber-crime police has seen many such cases and will be happy to help you (based on experience of someone I know).
