# UPI Payment Illusion

## Initiation
- You want to sell something on Quickr; or
- You receive a call that you've won a lottery; or
- In general a person wants to send you money.

## Process
- The person on the call asks you to scan a QR code in order for you to receive the money.
- To assure you that this won't deduct your money, they ask you to check by entering 2 rupees.
- You scan, enter 2 rupees, enter your UPI pin and proceed.
- You check your balance that it has increased by 2 rupees.
- You subsequently enter the full amount.
- The amount instead debits from your account.

## Mechanism
- The trickster misled you by sending 4 rupees as soon as they receive 2 rupees from you.

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- Remember that you NEVER require UPI pin if you're at the receiving end.
