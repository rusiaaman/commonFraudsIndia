# Impersonating as an Army man to do multiple types of fraud

## Initiation
You want to buy or sell something on FB / Quickr / online

## Process
1. The person who's buying or selling tells you he's in Army, and he's buying/selling because of transfer.
2. The person shows you army ID card, invoice from the Army Canteen store, etc.
3. Believing that an army guy would never cheat, you send money (if you're buying) or follow his instructions to get lured into UPI fraud.
4. If you sent money for buying, you don't get anything delivered. The person vanishes with your money.

## Mechanism
Gaining trust by impersonating as an army personnel and inducing sense of patriotism.

## Best practices to prevent the fraud
- Do not send money online if you're buying something unless the website is reputed.
